# Time-Series-Sales-LSTM
Time Series Forecast using Deep Learning (LSTM)

This is another implementation of the project in the Time-Series_Sales repository, about sales forecast (predicting sales), but at this time using Deep Learning. Again, It is based on a real data (monthly sales of a fast food restaurant) and probably the issue here was the size of the serie. I believe with longer serie we can get better results.

It was implemented using Keras.
